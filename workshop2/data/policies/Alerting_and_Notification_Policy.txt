Alerting and Notification Policy
Version: 1.0
Owner: IT Service Management

This policy describes when the triage service should trigger alerts, what channels to use, and how alerts relate to severity levels.


Section 1: When to Send Alerts

The triage service must decide whether to trigger alert notifications based on severity:

- For severity NORMAL:
  - Do not send email alerts.
  - Record the incident in the ticket history and metrics only.

- For severity ALERT:
  - Send an email alert to the standard incident distribution list.
  - Include a short summary, ticket_id, severity, and description.
  - Log that an alert was sent so it appears in the “alerts_sent” list.

- For severity CRISIS:
  - Send email alerts to both the standard incident list and crisis escalation list.
  - Use strong visual markers (for example, 🚨 in the subject) to signal urgency.
  - Ensure the alert includes the highest priority level (P0) and a clear call to action.


Section 2: Alert Content

Alert emails should contain at least:

- Ticket ID
- Severity
- Short summary of the issue
- Description of what was reported
- Basic recommended actions or pointers to runbooks

The triage service may also include metadata such as the AI model used and timestamp in the alert context.


Section 3: Logging Alerts in the System

Every alert sent by the triage service must be reflected in the structured response so that:

- The front-end can show an “alerts_sent” list with type, status, subject, message, recipients, and provider.
- The processing log can indicate that an email notification was triggered (for example, “Triggering email notification to incident list…” followed by “✅ Email sent successfully”).
- Metrics such as totalTickets, crises, and successRate can be updated accordingly.

Alerts and alert failures are part of the long-term audit trail and should be preserved for later review.
