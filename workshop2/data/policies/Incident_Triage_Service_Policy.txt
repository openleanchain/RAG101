Incident Triage Service Policy
Version: 1.0
Owner: IT Operations / AI Platform

This policy describes how our AI-powered incident triage service should classify incidents, produce structured results, and support IT repair workflows.

It applies to all tickets created in the IT Repair Hero Academy demos and any future extensions of the triage service.


Section 1: Incident Inputs and Scenarios

The triage service receives a short free-text description of an issue, such as:
- "Printer not working in office 3B"
- "API response time is very slow, timing out after 30 seconds"
- "Database server is completely down, no connections possible"
- "Security breach detected in production environment"

Each description is turned into a ticket with a unique ticket_id and processed by the triage logic and AI model.


Section 2: Severity Levels

The triage service must assign exactly one severity value to every incident:

- Severity NORMAL:
  - Minor or routine issues.
  - Limited to a small number of users or a non-critical system.
  - Example: single user printer issues, minor UI glitches, general “how to” questions.

- Severity ALERT:
  - Noticeable impact on business operations.
  - Affects multiple users, a team, or an important but non-core system.
  - Example: API responses are very slow or timing out for many users.

- Severity CRISIS:
  - Major impact or outage of a critical system.
  - Affects many users or core business processes.
  - Example: production database completely down, confirmed security breach.


Section 3: Triage Output Fields

For every ticket, the triage service must return a structured result with at least these fields:

- severity: one of NORMAL, ALERT, or CRISIS.
- summary: a short description of the issue and impact.
- category: a high-level area, such as Database, Network, Security, Compute, or General.
- priority: a label such as P0, P1, or P2 based on severity.
- impact: brief text describing business impact (HIGH, MEDIUM, or LOW).
- actions_taken: list of immediate actions the system has already performed (for example, “Ticket created in system”, “Notifications sent to 2 recipient(s)”).
- next_steps: list of recommended follow-up actions for humans or other systems.
- estimated_resolution: a rough time window for resolving the issue (for example, “15-30 minutes”, “1-2 hours”, or “4-8 hours”).

These fields are used by the web UI, metrics dashboard, and history view to present a consistent, machine-readable incident record.
