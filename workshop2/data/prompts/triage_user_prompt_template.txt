You will receive:
1) INTERNAL POLICIES (selected snippets from our enterprise policies and procedures).
2) An INCIDENT DESCRIPTION (what the user or system reported).

Follow the rules and JSON schema defined below.

[INTERNAL_POLICIES]
{policy_context}

[INCIDENT_DESCRIPTION]
{incident_text}

Your tasks:
1. Read the INTERNAL POLICIES and the INCIDENT DESCRIPTION carefully.
2. Decide the incident severity using the policy definitions and your severity rules from the system message.
3. Fill out the JSON fields as specified in the system message:
   - "summary": 1–3 sentences summarizing the issue and impact.
   - "severity": one of "NORMAL", "ALERT", or "CRISIS".
   - "actions_now": immediate concrete actions.
   - "next_steps": follow-up actions.
   - "estimated_time_hours": numeric estimate of total time to resolve.
   - "requires_policy_update": true if policies are unclear or missing, otherwise false.
   - "policy_refs": list of policy section references you relied on (e.g. "IncidentPolicy.txt#sec1").

Important:
- Prefer the INTERNAL POLICIES over your own assumptions.
- If policies do not cover the situation, be honest, choose a reasonable severity, and set "requires_policy_update": true.
- Do not invent policy names, SLAs, or steps that conflict with the provided policies.

Return your answer as a single JSON object in this format (no comments, no extra text):

{{
  "summary": "short summary of the issue and impact",
  "severity": "NORMAL",
  "actions_now": [
    "first immediate action",
    "second immediate action"
  ],
  "next_steps": [
    "first follow-up step",
    "second follow-up step"
  ],
  "estimated_time_hours": 2.0,
  "requires_policy_update": false,
  "policy_refs": [
    "IncidentPolicy.txt#sec1",
    "EscalationGuide.txt#sec2"
  ],
  "Alternative": "If you are very confident, you may suggest an alternative temporary solution if the user cannot wait."
}}
